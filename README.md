# Tutorial Mod

This Repository contains all the source code for my Terraria Modding Tutorial series. All the code on here should work with tModLoader 0.10 of greater. Some of the code will not work with older versions of tModLoader due to a change in how the code is written. 

Please feel free to use the source how you wish, I highly recommend that you do not use the images used in the tutorial as they are terrible and are just to show stuff working. 

If you are receiving errors in your code even after you have downloaded the source code please ensure that the namespace matches the namespace for your mod. (Replace all namespace TutorialMod to namespace YOURNAMESPACE)

If you have followed the tutorials and are getting an error, please ensure that you have tModLoader installed, you can do this by launching terraria and seeing if it tells you what version of tModLoader you are using. If you do not see it then you have not installed it. 

If you are using the Skeleton and have Terraria in a different install folder outside of the program files, please refer to the video "Terraria Modding Tutorial - Common Mistakes and Fixes - tModLoader 0.10" as I will be covering what you need to do in there. 
If you are reading this before I release the video just make sure all references to the normal steam directory are changed to the new directory.
